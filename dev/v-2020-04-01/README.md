Last night's deployment from dev to stable went badly - even with Harald's watchful eyes closely monitoring the changes. So today is about streamlining some of that process.


## Stable

* move the three scripts into a calver folder
	* To make ```dev``` and ```stable``` folder structure identical
	* Should help for easier deployment
* Update the links in the two index files

## Dev



### js/main.js

* Play around with vars to help with calver
* Updates messages
* Better handling of moving the splash, pop-up div

### js/mas-menu-app-switch.js

* Change options to simple html text
* Split select options into three stable and three dev

### js/dmt-div-move-touch.js

* Better handling of moving the splash, pop-up div
