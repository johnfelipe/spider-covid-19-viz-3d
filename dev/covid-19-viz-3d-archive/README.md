## "Don't make me change"

* All versions of a Spider web page - present and past - are runnable and viewable in your browser
	* Why: Refute Clarke's third law: to remind that software is not magic but the result of hard work, perseverance and care
	* Why: Debug visual appearance: to be able to see and compare before and after
	* Why: Mitigate Change Aversion - allow a user of any version to stay with that version
